1. Bike Class: The "bike.py" file will define a Bike class, which will be used in "main.py", "race.py", and "track.py". This class will include attributes like speed, position, and methods like move(), accelerate(), decelerate().

2. Race Class: The "race.py" file will define a Race class, which will be used in "main.py". This class will include attributes like participants (list of Bike objects), track, and methods like start(), end(), check_winner().

3. Track Class: The "track.py" file will define a Track class, which will be used in "race.py" and "main.py". This class will include attributes like length, obstacles, and methods like display_track().

4. Obstacle Class: The "obstacles.py" file will define an Obstacle class, which will be used in "track.py". This class will include attributes like position, size, and methods like display_obstacle().

5. Main Function: The "main.py" file will contain the main function which will use the Bike, Race, and Track classes to run the game.

6. Documentation: Each Python file will have a corresponding documentation file in the "docs" directory. These documentation files will explain the purpose and usage of each class and its methods.

7. Shared Variables: Some variables like game_status (to check if the game is running or not), winner (to store the winner of the race), bikes (list of all Bike objects), and track (Track object for the race) will be shared across multiple files.

8. Shared Functions: Some utility functions like check_collision (to check if a bike has hit an obstacle) and display_game (to display the current state of the game) might be shared across multiple files.
