Bike Class Documentation

File: bike.py

The Bike class represents a bike in the bike racing game. It is used in the main.py, race.py, and track.py files.

Attributes:
- speed (int): The current speed of the bike. It is initially set to 0.
- position (tuple): The current position of the bike on the track. It is initially set to (0, 0).

Methods:
- move(): Moves the bike based on its current speed and direction. It updates the position attribute.
- accelerate(): Increases the speed of the bike by 1 unit.
- decelerate(): Decreases the speed of the bike by 1 unit. The speed will not go below 0.

Example Usage:

```python
# Creating a new bike
bike = Bike()

# Accelerating the bike
bike.accelerate()

# Moving the bike
bike.move()

# Decelerating the bike
bike.decelerate()
```

Note: The Bike class does not handle collisions. Collisions are handled by the check_collision function in the main.py file.
