Obstacle Class Documentation

File: obstacles.py

The Obstacle class is defined in the obstacles.py file. This class is used in the track.py file to create obstacles on the track.

Class Attributes:
1. position: This attribute represents the position of the obstacle on the track. It is a tuple of two integers representing the x and y coordinates.
2. size: This attribute represents the size of the obstacle. It is an integer.

Class Methods:
1. display_obstacle(): This method is used to display the obstacle on the track. It prints the position and size of the obstacle.

Usage:

To create an obstacle:
```python
obstacle = Obstacle((5, 10), 3)
```

To display an obstacle:
```python
obstacle.display_obstacle()
```

This will print something like:
"Obstacle at position (5, 10) with size 3"

Note: The Obstacle class does not handle collisions. The check_collision function in the main.py file is used to check if a bike has hit an obstacle.
