Track Class Documentation

The Track class is defined in the "track.py" file. It is used in the "race.py" and "main.py" files. 

Attributes:
- length (int): The length of the track. It is defined in units where each unit represents a certain distance in the game.
- obstacles (list): A list of Obstacle objects. Each obstacle has a position and size.

Methods:
- display_track(): This method is used to display the current state of the track. It prints the track with the positions of the obstacles.

Usage:

To create a Track object, you need to specify the length and the obstacles. Here is an example:

    track = Track(100, [Obstacle(20, 2), Obstacle(50, 3)])

This creates a track of length 100 units with two obstacles. The first obstacle is at position 20 and has a size of 2 units. The second obstacle is at position 50 and has a size of 3 units.

To display the track, you can use the display_track() method:

    track.display_track()

This will print the track with the positions of the obstacles.
