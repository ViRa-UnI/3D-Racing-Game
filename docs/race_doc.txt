Race Class Documentation

The Race class is defined in the "race.py" file. It is used in the "main.py" file to control the flow of the game.

Attributes:
- participants: A list of Bike objects participating in the race.
- track: An instance of the Track class representing the track on which the race is happening.

Methods:
- start(): This method starts the race. It sets the game_status variable to True and initializes the positions of all bikes to the start of the track.
- end(): This method ends the race. It sets the game_status variable to False and determines the winner of the race.
- check_winner(): This method checks if any of the bikes have reached the end of the track. If a bike has reached the end, it calls the end() method and sets the winner variable to the winning bike.

Usage:

To use the Race class, first import it from the "race.py" file. Then, create an instance of the Race class, passing in a list of Bike objects and a Track object.

from race import Race
from bike import Bike
from track import Track

bikes = [Bike(), Bike(), Bike()]
track = Track()
race = Race(bikes, track)

To start the race, call the start() method on the race object.

race.start()

To check if there is a winner, call the check_winner() method on the race object.

race.check_winner()

If there is a winner, the check_winner() method will automatically call the end() method to end the race.
